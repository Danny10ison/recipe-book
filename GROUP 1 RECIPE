3 cups chicken or vegetable broth
2 teaspoons tomato paste
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon thyme
2 bay leaves
2 teaspoons curry powder
2 teaspoons dried thyme
2 teaspoons paprika
Salt and pepper to taste

Optional: 1 cup green peas and/or diced carrots

Instructions:

Prep the Ingredients:

Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear.
Blend the tomatoes and red bell peppers until smooth.
Chop the onions and mince the garlic.
Parboil the Rice:

In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add the rice.
Parboil the rice for about 7-10 minutes until it's partially cooked.
Drain the parboiled rice and set it aside.
Prepare the Jollof Sauce:

In the same pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat.
Add the chopped onions and sauté until they become translucent.
Add the minced garlic and sauté for another minute.
Stir in the blended tomatoes and red bell peppers, and cook for about
10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until the mixture thickens.

Season the Sauce:

Add the tomato paste, thyme, bay leaves, curry powder, dried thyme, paprika, salt, and pepper.
Mix well.
Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and bring the mixture to a boil.

Add the Rice:

Stir in the parboiled rice, ensuring that it's well coated with the sauce.
Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and simmer for
20-25 minutes or until the rice is cooked and has absorbed the flavors.

Optional Vegetables:

If using green peas and/or diced carrots, add them to the rice about 10 minutes before it's
done cooking.

Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork to separate the grains.
Remove the bay leaves before serving.
