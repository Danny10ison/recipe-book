3 cups chicken or vegetable broth
2 teaspoons tomato paste
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon thyme
2 bay leaves
2 teaspoons curry powder

Salt and pepper to taste

Optional: 1 cup green peas and/or diced carrots

Instructions:

Prep the Ingredients:

Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear.
Blend the tomatoes and red bell peppers until smooth.
Chop the onions and mince the garlic.
Parboil the Rice:

In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add the rice.
Parboil the rice for about 7-10 minutes until it's partially cooked.
Drain the parboiled rice and set it aside.
Prepare the Jollof Sauce:

In the same pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat.
Add the chopped onions and sautÃ© until they become translucent.

Stir in the blended tomatoes and red bell peppers, and cook for about
10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until the mixture thickens.

Season the Sauce:

Add the tomato paste, thyme, bay leaves, curry powder, dried thyme, paprika, salt, and pepper.
Mix well.
Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and bring the mixture to a boil.

Add the Rice:

Stir in the parboiled rice, ensuring that it's well coated with the sauce.
Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and simmer for
20-25 minutes or until the rice is cooked and has absorbed the flavors.

Optional Vegetables:

If using green peas and/or diced carrots, add them to the rice about 10 minutes before it's
done cooking.

Serve:

Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork to separate the grains.
Remove the bay leaves before serving.
Serve the Nigerian Jollof rice hot, and enjoy!
